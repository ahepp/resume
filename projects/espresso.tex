\noindent \textbf{Espresso Machine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added custom Raspberry Pi Zero W based PID controller to Gaggia espresso machine, resulting in 30x reduction in temperature steady state error.
    \item Wrote Linux driver for thermocouple ADC and successfully submitted to mainline Linux kernel.
    \item Built custom Buildroot-based Linux OS for target board to incorporate custom drivers, applications, and configuration settings into a single distributable SD card image.
    \item Wrote custom PID control software in C and Rust.
    \item Wrote web UI with Rust backend using inter-process communication to enable online PID tuning.
    \item Profiled temperature stability and analyzed with Octave to generate graphics for blog posts.
\end{itemize}
